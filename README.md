# Homelessness: Rough sleeping five times higher than official figure

Official figures on rough sleeping in England currently only record the numbers counted or estimated to be sleeping out on a single night.

Ahead of the release of the latest figures, we sent FOI requests to every council in the UK responsible for housing and asked how many individuals they recorded sleeping rough over an entire year.

In February 2020 we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-51398425) on the results.

We found 28,000 cases recorded, 25,000 of them in England, and this was five times higher than the previous single night snapshot had shown.

About three quarters had usable figures, although they counted in different ways. For London we had to use the 2018-19 CHAIN figures and for some councils in Wales we were referred to official Welsh government statistics. In Scotland councils provided figures for housing applicants who said they’d slept rough at some point in the preceding three months.

The figures do not contradict the government’s single night snapshot, but they do show there are many more people who sleep rough over the course of a year than are recorded in the snapshot.

The homelessness charity Crisis has called for better recording to show the true scale of the problem of rough sleeping.
