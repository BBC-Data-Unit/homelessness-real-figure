# FOI request sent to local authorities

*The FOI request sent to local authorities for this story asked for the following:*

1. How many individual rough sleepers have been identified in your area during the calendar year 2019 (January to December)?
2. If known, how many individual rough sleepers have been identified in your area during the calendar years 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018? Please provide an answer for any of those years for which you have data.
3. If available, how many of the rough sleepers identified during 2019 were found accommodation?
4. Please could you explain or link to what your authority does to identify rough sleepers and assist them to come off the streets.
 
Please note in the questions above I do not wish you to use your single autumn night snapshot figure that you provide to the government as part of the annual rough sleeping statistics published by MHCLG. I would like to know about the total number of individuals identified throughout the year.

However, if you have that snapshot figure available and are willing to disclose it now, please do so in addition to answering the above questions, which cover individuals identified throughout the years.

By “individual rough sleepers” I want to know about the number of people who were identified as rough sleepers, regardless of whether they were identified as sleeping rough once or at various points in the year. EG, if someone was identified as having slept rough once I would like them to be included. If someone slept rough on two or more occasions, punctuated by a period of not sleeping rough, I would like them to be included.
